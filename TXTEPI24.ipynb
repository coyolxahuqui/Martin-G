Human papillomavirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, \\nNeisseria gonorrhea and Mycoplasma genitalium are four of the most prevalent genital \\ninfections. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhea and M. genitalium are curable bacterial sexually \\ntransmitted infections. They affect predominantly young people and can result in long-term \\ndevastating complications.\\n\\nIn 2012, there were 127 and 27 million adults living with C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhea \\nworldwide [2]. Both infections are mainly asymptomatic [3]. If left untreated, C. trachomatis \\ninfection can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and tubal \\ninfertility [4]. C. trachomatis infection is also associated with pregnancy adverse outcomes \\nsuch as chorioamnionitis [5], preterm delivery [6], and low birth weight [7]. M. genitalium is \\nan emerging STI. Its prevalence among low-risk and high-risk populations worldwide is \\nestimated to be 2.0% and 7.3% respectively [8]. It is thought to be associated with urethritis, \\ncervicitis [9], PID [10] and tubal infertility [11]. These elements combined with its high \\nprevalence close to that of C. trachomatis, makes it a subject of concern. Human \\npapillomavirus (HPV) infections are strongly associated with cervical cancer [12\\u201315] in \\nparticular HPV genotypes 16 and 18. Up to 80% of women will be infected by HPV over \\ntheir lifetime [16].\\n\\nHowever, not all sexual contacts with these pathogens lead to infections, and not all \\ninfections evolve towards long-term complications, which suggest that factors such as the \\nvaginal microbiota, host innate and adaptive immunity, pathogen fitness and load may \\nmodulate the natural history of these infections. Molecular and high-throughput sequencing \\nof 16S rRNA gene amplicons has led to an improved and in-depth characterization of the \\ncomposition of vaginal microbiota [17\\u201319]. These studies have identified different kinds of \\nvaginal microbiota that are either dominated by one of four species of Lactobacillus (L. \\ncrispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri and L. jensenii) or characterized by a paucity of Lactobacillus \\nspp. and a diverse set of strict and facultative anaerobes. The latter is associated with high \\nNugent score, a research tool used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV). The Nugent score \\nenumerates the number of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis and curved Gram-negative \\nrods on a Gram-stained vaginal smear. A score between 7 and 10 is indicative of BV (no \\n\\nClin Microbiol Infect.

We hypothesize that the vaginal microbiota \\ninteracts with sexually transmitted pathogens in two forms: different vaginal microbiotae \\ncould contribute differentially to the physiopathology of genital infections and their long-\\nterm sequelae, and STI pathogens could influence the vaginal microbiota composition. This \\nputative two-way biological interaction should therefore be reflected in a statistical \\nassociation in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Improved knowledge on these \\naspects could lay the foundation for the development of probiotics that may constitute a \\nsimpler and better prevention and/or restorative approach. Our review constitutes a first step \\ntowards clarifying the interrelation between STI pathogens and the vaginal microbiota.\\n\\nThe objective of this review is to evaluate the statistical association between C. trachomatis, \\nN. gonorrhea, M. genitalium, and HPV infections, four of the most common STIs, and the \\nvaginal microbiota, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.\\n\\nMedline and the Web of Science were searched from January 2000 to December 2016 (last \\nsearch January 1st, 2017) for relevant studies on association between vaginal microbiota and \\nHuman Papillomavirus, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium and N. gonorrhea infections.

LL-VMB is characterized by a paucity of Lactobacillus and a wide array of \\nstrict and facultative anaerobes. This definition correlated well with Nugent score 7\\u201310 \\ncategory and a positive Amsel\\u2019s test, as well as with the presence of clue cells. HL-VMB \\ncorresponded to vaginal community state types dominated by either L. crispatus, L. iners, L. \\ngasseri and L. jensenii, low Nugent score (0\\u20136) and a negative Amsel\\u2019s score.\\n\\nMeasure of association\\u2014A random effects model assuming heterogeneity amongst the \\nstudies within the metan command in Stata 14.0 was used to summarize the effect sizes. The \\neffect sizes were either odds-ratios (OR), relative risks (RR), hazard ratios (HR) or incidence \\nrate ratios (IRR). When an adjusted measure of association was available with details on \\nconfounders, this measure and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used for the meta-\\nanalysis rather than the raw estimate. When no measure of association was available, raw \\ndata were used to calculate an OR with its 95% CI using the Mantel-Haenzsel method. \\nEstimates of association retrieved from the studies and their CIs were displayed in forest \\nplots.\\n\\nAssessment of Risk of Bias and heterogeneity in included studies\\u2014For each \\nSTI considered in this review, funnel plots were performed to evaluate the existence of a \\npublication bias. These plots were combined with Egger\\u2019s tests. The Cochran\\u2019s Q two-sided \\nhomogeneity test [23] and the I2 statistic were used to assess the heterogeneity in measures \\nof association among the included studies. Subgroup analyses were performed when the Q-\\ntest was statistically significant at the 5% level or if the I2 statistic was greater than 50%, to \\nidentify potential sources of heterogeneity. Cochran\\u2019s Q two-sided heterogeneity test was \\nalso used to compare subgroups.\\n\\nThe methodological quality of selected studies as relevant to this review\\u2019s research objective \\nwas assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, consisting of a \\u201cstar system\\u201d, with a \\nmaximum of 9 stars to be attributed (Supplementary Table 1).\\n\\nClin Microbiol Infect.

We \\nremoved 72 articles because they did not fit the inclusion criteria. After adding 6 articles \\nthrough cross-referencing, 39 articles were left for analysis (Figure 1). Among these 39 \\narticles, 11 used Amsel\\u2019s criteria, 20 used Nugent score, 3 used the presence of clue cells \\nand one article used both Amsel\\u2019s criteria and Nugent score to characterize LL-VMB, while \\n4 used 16S rRNA gene sequencing for vaginal microbiota characterization. Of the 39 \\nselected studies, 19 were cohort studies and 20 were cross-sectional studies. As the \\nassociation between vaginal microbiota and STI was not always the primary objective of the \\nselected studies, the data was only available at baseline in 6 of the 19 cohort studies (cross-\\nsectional data type). Longitudinal data on vaginal microbiota and STIs was available for 13 \\nof the 19 cohort studies. Cohort studies allowed identifying incident cases of infection, but \\neven with incident cases of infection, the vaginal microbiota was not always assessed prior \\nto infection, but rather at the same visit as the incident infection, and was assessed after \\ninfection only in one study (Bradshaw et al. 2013). When the vaginal microbiota was \\nassessed prior to infection, the time lapse varied between 3 months and 2 years. A total of 20 \\narticles were used to evaluate the association between vaginal microbiota and HPV \\n(n=20,022 individuals), 17 for C. trachomatis (n=12,810), 8 for N. gonorrhea (n=8,799), and \\n4 for M. genitalium (n=2,894) (Supplementary Table 2).\\n\\nSTIs and low Lactobacillus-VMB\\n\\nIn the selected studies and the population studied, the proportion of women infected with \\nHPV ranged from 9.9% to 79.5%, from 4.8% to 72.9% for C. trachomatis, from 0.7% to \\n9.9% for N. gonorrhea, and 2.5% to 13.8% for M. genitalium (when available either in \\ncross-sectional studies or at baseline for longitudinal studies). Across all studies the \\nproportion of women carrying LL-VMB ranged from 3.1% to 70.9%.\\n\\nOverall association between vaginal microbiota and each STI\\n\\nFor HPV, measures of association with LL-VMB ranged from 0.60 (95% CI 0.30, 1.19) to \\n2.75 (95% CI 0.27, 28.04). Six studies out of 20 showed a significant association between \\nvaginal microbiota and HPV infection. These studies were significantly heterogeneous \\n(p<0.001). For C. trachomatis, measures of association with LL-VMB ranged from 0.70 \\n(95% CI 0.40, 1.20) to 5.24 (95% CI 1.86, 14.81). Nine studies out of 17 showed a \\nsignificant association. Q-test for heterogeneity showed a significant result as well (p = \\n0.018) (Figure 2). Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored in subgroup analyses \\n\\nClin Microbiol Infect.

Selected studies for N. gonorrhea were not significantly heterogeneous (p = \\n0.276), and measures of association ranged from 0.80 (95% CI 0.50, 1.40) to 3.75 (95% CI \\n0.39, 36.24) with only one study showing a significant association. For M. genitalium, three \\nstudies provided similar estimates of association, ranging from 0.44 (95% CI 0.13, 1.54) to \\n0.50 (95% CI 0.10, 3.40), but one study reported an estimate of association of 6.09 (95% CI \\n1.98, 18.50). For both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhea, sensitivity analyses excluding \\nstudies that provided estimates of association taking only the Nugent 0\\u20133 category as a \\nreference instead of all individuals in Nugent score 0\\u20133 and 4\\u20136 categories pooled together, \\ndid not modified the results significantly (Supplementary Figure 1).\\n\\nSubgroup analysis of association between vaginal microbiota and HPV or C. trachomatis \\n(Figure 3, 4)\\n\\nFor C. trachomatis, when measures of association were restricted to younger ages (<40 years \\nold), results were less heterogeneous and measures of association were consistent across \\nstudies, suggesting a positive association between vaginal microbiota and C. trachomatis \\ninfection. Difference in study sites (geographical area) was an important contributor to the \\nheterogeneity for both HPV and C. trachomatis. Though stratification by study sites resulted \\nin smaller clusters of studies and therefore less statistical power, measures of association \\nwere more consistent. For HPV, studies conducted in Asia showed higher measures of \\nassociation than elsewhere, and results from these studies were consistent (I2 = 0.0%, p = \\n0.635).\\n\\nAs selected studies provided different types of measures of association (OR, RR, HR or \\nIRR) that are not perfectly comparable, we assessed whether the type of measure of \\nassociation could partly explain the observed heterogeneity amongst studies. For both HPV \\nand C. trachomatis, no clear effect of the type of measure of association on the heterogeneity \\ncould be highlighted. Measures of association were slightly higher for adjusted measures for \\nboth HPV and C. trachomatis compared to non-adjusted measures, and only consistent with \\none another for C. trachomatis. Measures of association did not differ between studies where \\nthe vaginal microbiota was assessed prior to STI and studies where both were assessed at the \\nsame time, results were still highly heterogeneous. Additionally, a subgroup analysis on \\nincident versus prevalent cases of infection is presented in Supplementary Figure 3 and \\nshows no clear effect of this factor.\\n\\nLastly, the vaginal microbiota characterization method did not explain heterogeneity across \\nstudies for C. trachomatis. When restricted to studies that used Nugent score, results were \\nstill highly heterogeneous. However, for HPV, a trend for higher measures of association was \\nobserved when the method used was Amsel\\u2019s criteria.\\n\\nFunnel plots and Egger\\u2019s tests were performed for each STI and no publication bias could be \\nhighlighted for any of the considered STIs (Supplementary Figure 2), graphically or by \\nmeans of Egger\\u2019s test.\\n\\nEvaluation of methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Studies with lowest scores on this scale (5 \\nstars out of 9, for 4 studies out of 39) had cross-sectional designs and were lacking \\nadjustment on important cofactors for STI acquisition, in particular factors linked to recent \\nsexual exposure (e.g. number of partners in recent months/years, lifetime number of \\npartners).\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe vaginal ecosystem exists as a fine tuned equilibrium between microorganisms and the \\nhost. Modern next-generation sequencing-based characterization of the vaginal microbiota \\nhas provided a more in-depth and detailed composition of the microbiota. It distinguishes \\nseveral kinds of microbiota: high-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota corresponding to low \\nNugent scores and negative Amsel test, and a low-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota \\ncomprising a wide array of strict and facultative anaerobes, corresponding to high Nugent \\nscores and positive Amsel test [19, 24]. Thus, these methods align well despite having \\ndifferent resolutions. It is believed that a disruption of this equilibrium and a lack of \\nLactobacillus spp. could play a role in the physiopathology of reproductive tract infections, \\nsuch as C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhea, M. genitalium, or HPV. Conversely, STI pathogens \\ncould modify the vaginal microbiota composition. Stemming from this hypothesis and as a \\nfirst step towards understanding the interrelation between the vaginal microbiota and STIs, \\nour systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to our knowledge to evaluate \\nsystematically the statistical association between vaginal microbiota and these four STIs and \\nreflects the state of art on this topic.\\n\\nOur results suggested a trend towards a positive association between LL-VMB and HPV as \\nwell as C. trachomatis infection, which is coherent with in vitro studies suggesting a \\npotential protective role oh HL-VMB through lactic acid production, bacteriocin production \\nor ecological competition [25\\u201329]. On the contrary, no clear trend for an association \\nbetween vaginal microbiota and N. gonorrhea could be detected. Reasons for this difference \\ncould be linked to different characteristics of the considered pathogens in terms of infectivity \\nor pathogenicity. Regarding the potential role of microbiota, the ability of Lactobacillus spp. \\nto prevent N. gonorrhea infection or contribute to its resolution in vitro and in vivo has been \\ndebated previously [30]. As for M. genitalium infection, our systematic review primarily \\nhighlighted the fact that too few studies have been conducted, owing to the fact that M. \\ngenitalium importance is growing and less research studies have been undertaken.\\n\\nFor two of the four STIs considered this meta-analysis identified heterogeneity of the \\nmeasures of association with vaginal microbiota among the selected studies. Two factors \\nappeared to be important. Study site partially explained the heterogeneity observed amongst \\nstudies. This result suggests that another yet unknown factor such as the genetic background, \\nsexual practices or personal hygiene behaviors varying across geographical areas could \\ngreatly influence the composition of the vaginal microbiota. The microbiota characterization \\nmethod was another important factor driving the observed association. Indeed, the \\nassociation between LL-VMB and HPV infection was higher in studies using the Amsel\\u2019s \\ncriteria. As these criteria use both microscopy and clinical signs, and Nugent score is solely \\nbased on microscopy, the presence of clinical signs used in Amsel\\u2019s criteria might actually \\n\\nClin Microbiol Infect.

Under this hypothesis, a focus on combining \\nclinical signs detection and microbiological evaluation of the vaginal microbiota should be \\nexplored.\\n\\nThe present meta-analysis has several limitations. Though we selected studies where STI \\ndiagnosis was based on DNA or RNA detection, the methods used have different \\nsensitivities, which may have biased the results. To characterize the vaginal microbiota, four \\ndifferent methods were used: Amsel\\u2019s criteria, Nugent score, presence of clue cells, and 16S \\nrRNA gene sequencing. Evaluation of the vaginal microbiota according to the Nugent \\nscoring system, Amsel\\u2019s criteria and the presence of clue cells do not overlap perfectly and \\nhave low resolution [22, 31, 32]. While this could be considered a limitation, a strong \\ncorrelation exists between these methods and LL-VMB determined using 16S rRNA gene \\namplicon sequencing [19, 24].\\n\\nWe chose to pool data from all HL-VMB groups commonly identified by 16S rRNA gene \\nsequencing analysis (i.e. L. crispatus-, L. gasseri-, L. iners- and L. jensenii-dominated \\nCommunity State Types), while LL-VMB comprised of women presenting with a \\ncombination of diverse anaerobes, to fit the Nugent score and Amsel\\u2019s criteria. This pooling \\nmay not be relevant since different species of Lactobacillus may have different effects on \\nSTIs. Zozaya-Hinchliffe et al. have shown that L. crispatus and L. jensenii were \\npredominantly found in women with a 0\\u20133 Nugent score while L. iners could be found in \\nhigh proportions in all categories of the Nugent score, including the 7\\u201310 category [33]. The \\nuse of molecular techniques such as next-generation sequencing applied to genes conserved \\nin all Bacteria and Archaea (16S rRNA gene or cpn60 [34]) enables a more in-depth \\ncharacterization of the vaginal microbiota that could provide better insights into the \\nassociation between microbiota and STIs.\\n\\nGiven the different types of measures of association reported in the selected studies, no \\noverall measure of association could be inferred from our meta-analysis. Intrinsic to meta-\\nanalysis, the issue of publication bias arose, in particular when authors reported as not \\nsignificant (NS) the association between vaginal microbiota and a given STI, instead of \\nproviding the point estimate and its 95% CI or raw data. This was the case in one of the \\narticles reviewed for full reading and excluded for this reason [35]. Therefore, it is likely that \\nthe \\u201ctrue\\u201d value of the association between vaginal microbiota and a given STI is lower than \\nwhat could be evaluated by pooling published estimates.\\n\\nThere are strong biological arguments to support the hypothesis that LL-VMB and presence \\nof anaerobes is a risk factor for STI acquisition. First, Lactobacillus species are thought to be \\nprotective against STIs through competition, production of lactic acid that lowers pH, and \\nproduction of target-specific bacteriocins. Therefore, the absence of Lactobacillus species \\nwould lead to greater susceptibility to infections. Second, vaginal strict and facultative \\nanaerobes seem to produce nitrosamines, cytokines and inflammatory mediators that are \\nthought to be associated with cervical inflammation [36], and mucindegrading enzymes [37, \\n38] that lower barriers to infections. Because this LL-VMB state can persist over long period \\nof time or occur frequently in a large number of women [39], it might still represent a \\n\\nClin Microbiol Infect.

The ability to distinguish communities \\ndominated by different Lactobacillus spp. is important, as Lactobacillus spp. have unique \\nproperties with differential effects on STI pathogens. Further, studies that rely on \\nlongitudinal and prospective designs will need to be undertaken to address the directionality \\nof this complex association, in particular whether a change in the vaginal microbiota occurs \\nbefore, at the same time (similar or simultaneous transmission mode of the microbiota and \\nSTIs [35, 40]), or after an infection. Ultimately, more functional analyses of the vaginal \\nmicrobiota are necessary in the context of STIs, so that it can be leveraged into improved \\npublic health strategies. Understanding the relationship between sexually transmitted \\ninfections and the vaginal microbiota is key to propose a comprehensive approach to sexual \\nand reproductive health. Characterizing the vaginal microbiota will pave the way to new \\nprevention and screening strategies, diagnostic tools and therapeutic solutions based on \\nindividual\\u2019s predispositions to infection, including the development of probiotics.

Numerous\\nstudies have detected M genitalium in up to 22% of women\\nwith PID according to the CDC.3 We describe an adolescent\\nfemale with a prolonged and indolent course of pelvic pain\\ndiagnosed with PID secondary to M genitalium infection.\\n\\nCase\\n\\nA 17-year-old heterosexual female adolescent initially\\npresented to our pediatric gynecology of\\ufb01ce complaining of\\nworsening dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain.

She reported inconsistent\\ncondom use previously, but uses condoms 100% of the time\\nwith her current partner. She experienced dysuria only\\nduring menstruation. Her abdominal examination \\ufb01ndings\\nwere benign, and no cervical motion tenderness was noted\\non bimanual examination. She had no vaginal discharge but\\ndid have general tenderness on vulvar and vaginal exami-\\nnation.

No further gonorrhea and chlamydia\\ntesting were performed. In addition to antibiotic treatment\\nfor the mycoplasma infection, she was referred to mental\\nhealth and physical therapy services for chronic pelvic pain\\nmanagement.\\n\\nSummary and Conclusion\\n\\nPID is a serious sequela of sexually transmitted infections\\n(STIs) in sexually active adolescent females. The Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the preva-\\nlence among women 18-44 years to be 4.4% in the United\\nStates.4 N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis are the most com-\\nmon causes of acute PID; however, as many as 70% of PID\\ncases have no identi\\ufb01ed pathogen or are suspected to be\\npolymicrobial.5 There is increasing evidence that M genitalium\\nmay contribute to a substantial number of PID cases. In 2003,\\na case-control study performed in the United Kingdom re-\\nported that of a total of 82 women, 13% of the PID cases were\\npositive for M genitalium, whereas none of the control subjects\\ntested positive for the organism.6 A cross-sectional case-con-\\ntrol study by Bjartling et al demonstrated that the prevalence\\nof M genitalium (2.1%) was comparable to that of C trachomatis\\n\\n(2.8%) in women with PID and cervicitis.2 In a 2015 meta-\\nanalysis, M genitalium infection was found to be associated\\nwith a signi\\ufb01cantly increased risk of PID, with a pooled odds\\nratio of 2.14.7 In addition, a 2019 meta-analysis showed a risk\\nratio of 1.73 between M genitalium and PID.8\\n\\nThe clinical manifestations of M genitalium infection may\\nbe indistinguishable from those of C trachomatis.2 Some\\npatients may also be asymptomatic.9 Most reports describe\\nsymptoms consistent with PID, which include pelvic pain\\nand uterine tenderness, or signs of endometritis and\\ncervicitis.9 Patients may also have postcoital bleeding,\\ndysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge.2\\n\\nMost studies have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\\nassays to detect M genitalium.7 Recently, the Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) approved an Aptima Mycoplasma\\ngenitalium assay, a NAAT, which can detect the bacteria in\\nurine, urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, or vaginal\\nswabs. The ability to accurately detect M genitalium may\\nlead to a better understanding of the true disease burden.\\nM genitalium infection can be dif\\ufb01cult to treat, because the\\nspecies lacks a cell wall and can rapidly develop antibiotic\\nresistance. In addition, the lack of a cell wall makes the or-\\nganism intrinsically resistant to antibiotics such as penicil-\\nlins and cephalosporins that target cell wall biosynthesis.10\\nTetracyclines, macrolides, and \\ufb02uoroquinolones are stan-\\ndard choices for Mycoplasma species. Doxycycline has been\\nshown to have poor activity against M genitalium. Azi-\\nthromycin, either as a single dose or as a 5-day extended-\\nconsidered \\ufb01rst-line therapy, but\\ndose regimen,\\nnumerous reports of resistant strains have been published\\nand de\\ufb01nitive treatment guidelines do not exist.10 Fluo-\\nroquinolone resistance has also been reported; but currently,\\nmoxi\\ufb02oxacin has been shown to be the most effective anti-\\nmicrobial agent.10 Similar to other STIs, patients are advised\\nto maintain abstinence, to notify their partners, and to un-\\ndergo treatment until their symptoms have resolved.10 The\\nrecommendation for testing and treating the partner is\\nsupported by a systematic review in which up to 50% of\\ninfected individuals had a heterosexual partner with M\\ngenitalium.8 A test of cure should also be performed 3-\\n6 weeks after treatment because of high rates of resistance.11\\nOur case demonstrates how challenging the diagnosis of\\nM genitalium causing PID can be in adolescent females with\\natypical presentations and signi\\ufb01cant sequelae. Undetected\\nM genitalium can lead to extensive pelvic adhesions with\\n\\nis\\n\\n\\fT. Han et al. / J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol 33 (2020) 739e741\\n\\n741\\n\\nfuture fertility issues and chronic pain.10 Similar to M gen-\\nitalium in that it lacks a cell wall, U urealyticum is also part of\\nthe normal urogenital \\ufb02ora that could potentially become a\\nco-infection.1,5 Although Ureaplasma has been indicated as a\\npossible cause of PID, its impact is not well understood, and\\nfurther studies are required.1,5 Currently, there are no rec-\\nommendations as to whether M genitalium testing should\\nbe part of routine annual STI screening. In a patient with\\nsigns and symptoms of PID or chronic pelvic pain, M geni-\\ntalium should be included in the differential. Further studies\\nare needed to determine the incidence and prevalence of M\\ngenitalium in the asymptomatic young, sexually active fe-\\nmale population as well as individuals presenting with\\nclinical PID symptoms. These data could then be used to\\nestablish standardized testing and treatment guidelines for\\nM genitalium.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

We conducted descriptive analyses using data on diagnoses of PID\\u2014with and without Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) \\nand/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC)\\u2014by age and year of birth, in SSHSs between 2009 and 2019 from the GUMCAD STI Surveillance \\nSystem database. Rates were calculated per 100\\u00a0000 females residing in England.\\n\\nResults.  CT  screening  activity  peaked  in  2010.  The  rates  of  all  PID  diagnoses  decreased  between  2009  and  2019  by  39%. \\nCT-associated PID (CT-PID) declined by 58%, and nonspecific PID declined by 37%. GC-PID increased by 34%. CT-PID decreased \\nacross all age groups with the highest observed decline, 71%, in 15- to 19-year-olds. A\\u00a0dose-response relationship was observed be-\\ntween CT-PID rates and screening, with rates lowest in those with the greatest exposure to screening.\\n\\nConclusions.  There was a marked decline in diagnoses of CT-PID, and nonspecific PID, at SSHSs after the introduction of wide-\\nspread chlamydia screening, whereas GC-PID diagnoses increased. This ecological trend was broadly consistent with what we would \\nhave expected to see if widespread screening reduced the incidence of chlamydia-associated PID (and of nonspecific PID), as has \\nbeen observed in randomized controlled trials of screening.\\n\\nKeywords. \\n\\n chlamydia; chlamydia screening; pelvic inflammatory disease; surveillance.\\n\\nThe  National  Chlamydia  Screening  Programme  (NCSP)  was \\nestablished in England in 2003 and nationally implemented by \\n2008 with the aim of controlling chlamydia in young, sexually \\nactive people, among whom incidence was known to be higher. \\nTogether  with  the  introduction  of  nucleic  acid  amplification \\ntesting technologies from 2003, this resulted in large increases \\nin chlamydia screening and diagnoses: 2.3 million tests were re-\\nported  in  2010  among  15-  to  24-year-olds,  equivalent  to  44% \\nof  females  and  24%  of  males  in  this  age  group,  if  only  1  test \\nper\\u00a0person.\\n\\nPelvic  inflammatory  disease  (PID)  encompasses  a  range  of \\nupper genital tract inflammatory disorders in females that re-\\nsult from the spread of microorganisms from the lower to the \\n\\n \\n\\nPresented in part: STI & HIV 2019 World Congress, Joint Meeting of the 23rd International \\nSociety  for  Sexually  Transmitted  Diseases  Research  and  20th  International  Union  Against \\nSexually Transmitted Infections, Vancouver, Canada, 14\\u201317 July 2019.\\n\\nCorrespondence:  Grahame  S.\\u00a0 Davis,  PhD,  Blood  Safety,  Hepatitis,  Sexually  Transmitted \\nInfections  and  HIV  Service,  Public  Health  England,  61  Colindale  Ave,  London  NW9  5EQ,  UK \\n(grahame.davis@phe.gov.uk).\\nThe Journal of Infectious Diseases\\u00ae \\n\\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

Genital  infection  with  Chlamydia \\ntrachomatis  (CT)  is  1  of  the  principal  causes  of  PID  and  has \\nbeen estimated to account for around 35% of cases in females \\naged  16\\u201324\\u00a0 years,  decreasing  to  around  11%  in  females  aged \\n25\\u201344\\u00a0years in England [1\\u20133]. Other sexually transmitted infec-\\ntions (STIs) that can cause PID include Neisseria gonorrhoeae \\n(GC) and Mycoplasma genitalium [1, 2, 4, 5]. The importance \\nof PID as an outcome measure for the evaluation of STI con-\\ntrol  lies  not  only  in  its  direct  impact  on  health,  but  also  as  a \\nprecursor  of  more  serious  conditions  including  ectopic  preg-\\nnancy and infertility [1, 2, 6]. However as the proportion of PID \\ncaused  by  chlamydia  decreases  with  age,  changes  in  all-cause \\nPID, which is what is usually reported nationally, tells us little \\nabout the effectiveness of chlamydia control programs [3, 7].\\n\\nIn England, females with PID can present to primary care, \\nhospital  or  specialist  genitourinary  medicine,  and  integrated \\ngenitourinary  medicine/sexual  and  reproductive  health  spe-\\ncialist sexual health services (SSHSs) [3, 6]. While it is unclear \\nwhat proportion of females with PID are diagnosed at SSHSs, \\nthese services are available free of charge to all females at risk \\nof STIs [3, 6].

We explore available data about PID diagnoses \\nand associated infections in SSHSs in England to inform evalu-\\nation of chlamydia screening.\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nData\\u00a0Source\\n\\nWe  used  data  from  the  GUMCAD  STI  Surveillance  System, \\nthe national STI surveillance system in England. It is a pseudo-\\nanonymized  patient-level  dataset  that  includes  information \\non  all  attendances,  tests,  and  diagnoses  at  SSHSs  in  England. \\nEach attendance is reported with demographic information in-\\ncluding  age,  gender,  sexual  orientation,  ethnicity,  and  patient \\narea of residence. Patient records can be linked within, but not \\nacross  clinics,  using  a  clinic  patient  number  that  is  unique  to \\neach individual [8, 9].\\n\\nWe included data on all diagnoses of PID\\u2014with and without \\nCT  and/or  GC\\u2014of  bacterial  vaginosis  and  of  anogenital \\ncandidosis made at SSHSs between 2009 and 2019. Counts and \\nrates  of  diagnoses  were  calculated  for  15-  to  34-year-olds  in \\n5-year age groups, for females only.\\n\\nValidation and Data Management\\n\\nTo explore the potential effect of changes in access to (or use \\nof)  SSHSs  over  this  time,  we  used  data  on  the  total  number \\nof  female  attendances  and  changes  in  diagnoses  of  vaginosis/\\nvaginitis  (bacterial  vaginosis  and  candidosis).  This  measure \\nwas chosen as a symptomatic clinical presentation with no ac-\\ntive control program,  with  the assumption  that  the  frequency \\nof  these  conditions  in  the  population  is  relatively  stable  and \\ntherefore likely\\u2014we proposed\\u2014to be reflective of variations in \\nservice use for symptomatic conditions. Attendances were used \\nas a measure of access for symptomatic and asymptomatic\\u00a0care.\\nTo investigate the potential impact of changes in service use, \\nindicated by attendance for symptomatic conditions with stable \\nepidemiology, the ratio of CT PID and nonspecific PID to any \\nvaginosis/vaginitis diagnoses was calculated.\\n\\nIndividuals who had a diagnosis of nonspecific PID and CT \\non  the  same  day  were  considered  to  have  CT-associated  PID \\n(herein referred to as CT-PID), and those who had a diagnosis \\nof nonspecific PID and GC were considered to have GC-PID. \\nPID codes were de-duplicated with a patient only able to have 1 \\ndiagnosis of PID in a 42-day period, reflecting the standard du-\\nration of an episode of care in SSHSs [8, 10]; if there were mul-\\ntiple codes within a 42-day period then a CT/GC PID diagnosis \\nwas  kept  over  any  nonspecific  PID  diagnosis,  and  a  GC-PID \\ncoding was kept over a CT-PID coding.\\n\\nIn 2012, these 2 data sources were replaced by a single labora-\\ntory reporting system, the Chlamydia Testing Activity Dataset \\n(CTAD). CTAD now provides detailed reports at national and \\nlocal  levels  on  chlamydia  screening  activity  in  15-  to  24-year \\nolds. Data were extracted for 2009\\u20132019 to show trends in this \\nwider screening activity alongside testing data from SSHS.\\n\\nPopulation\\u00a0Data\\n\\nRates were calculated per 100\\u00a0000 females residing in England \\nusing  Office  for  National  Statistics  midyear  population  esti-\\nmates as denominators [11].\\n\\nBirth\\u00a0Cohorts\\n\\nTo  evaluate  the  dose-response  relationship  between  PID  and \\nchlamydia  screening,  birth-cohort  groupings  were  defined \\nby  exposure  to  widespread  screening  through  the  NCSP.

For  both  CT-PID  and  nonspecific \\nPID,  the  decline  post-2012  was  lessened  when  this  ratio  was \\nconsidered; however, the declining trend from 2009 to 2012 re-\\nmained and the lower rate was maintained after 2012 (Figure 3).\\n\\nS116  \\u2022  jid  2021:224  (Suppl 2)  \\u2022  Davis et\\u00a0al\\n\\nl\\n\\nD\\no\\nw\\nn\\no\\na\\nd\\ne\\nd\\n\\n \\nf\\nr\\no\\nm\\nh\\n\\n \\n\\nt\\nt\\n\\np\\ns\\n:\\n/\\n/\\n\\ni\\n\\na\\nc\\na\\nd\\ne\\nm\\nc\\n.\\no\\nu\\np\\n.\\nc\\no\\nm\\n\\n/\\nj\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\nd\\na\\nr\\nt\\ni\\nc\\ne\\n2\\n2\\n4\\nS\\nu\\np\\np\\ne\\nm\\ne\\nn\\n_\\n2\\nS\\n1\\n1\\n3\\n6\\n3\\n5\\n2\\n1\\n4\\n9\\nb\\ny\\n \\nI\\n\\nt\\n\\n/\\n\\n \\n\\n/\\n\\nn\\ns\\nt\\n \\nI\\n\\ni\\n\\ni\\n\\nn\\nv\\n \\nB\\no\\nm\\ne\\nd\\nc\\na\\ns\\n \\nu\\ns\\ne\\nr\\n \\no\\nn\\n1\\n0\\nA\\nu\\ng\\nu\\ns\\nt\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2\\n0\\n2\\n3\\n\\n\\fs\\ni\\nt\\ni\\nn\\ni\\ng\\na\\nv\\n/\\ns\\ni\\ns\\no\\nn\\ni\\ng\\na\\nv\\n \\ny\\nn\\na\\n \\n\\no\\nt\\n \\n\\nD\\nI\\nP\\n-\\nT\\nC\\n\\n \\nf\\no\\n\\n \\n\\no\\n\\ni\\nt\\na\\nr\\n \\ns\\ni\\ns\\no\\nn\\ng\\na\\ni\\nD\\n\\n0.10\\n\\n0.09\\n\\n0.08\\n\\n0.07\\n\\n0.06\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n0.00\\n\\n \\n\\nn\\no\\ni\\nt\\na\\nl\\nu\\np\\no\\np\\n \\ne\\nl\\na\\nm\\ne\\nf\\n \\n\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n\\n \\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\n,\\ns\\ne\\nt\\na\\nr\\n \\n\\nD\\nI\\nP\\n-\\nT\\nC\\n\\n80\\n\\n70\\n\\n60\\n\\n50\\n\\n40\\n\\n30\\n\\n20\\n\\n10\\n\\n0\\n\\n2009\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2014\\nYear\\n\\nNonspeci\\ufb01c PID\\n\\nCT PID\\n\\nFigure 3.

The \\nguidelines used in these settings have, since 2005, advised a low \\nindex  of  clinical  suspicion  when  diagnosing  PID,  particularly \\nin  females  <25\\u00a0 years  of  age,  as  the  symptoms  and  signs  lack \\nsensitivity and specificity [2, 12, 13]. Thus, these criteria have \\nremained  essentially  unchanged  over  the  study  period.  The \\nfraction  of  PID  associated  with  CT  decreases  with  increasing \\nage, being greatest in females <25\\u00a0years old [3]. In this study we \\nwere able to look at changes in CT-PID rates in 15- to 24-year-\\nolds and 25- to 34-year-olds, enabling us to adjust for potential \\nchanges in age distribution of female attendees over\\u00a0time.\\n\\nAccess  to  SSHSs  has  changed  over  the  study  time  period \\nwith  the  number  of  attendances  increasing  [14,  15].  Changes \\nin access\\u2014that is, reduction in clinical capacity associated with \\nrising demand for asymptomatic screening\\u2014could potentially \\nreduce the number of PID attendances. We were able to explore \\nthis by examining the changes in PID diagnoses compared to \\nvaginal discharge caused by candidosis and bacterial vaginosis, \\nrates of which should remain constant within the population. \\nFalls in CT-PID were still observed after adjusting for changes \\nin these other diagnoses, although they were not as great.\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nThis was an ecological study and although the changes in PID \\nrates were consistent with what one would expect to see if higher \\nlevels of screening, as facilitated by the NCSP, were effective it \\nwas not possible to infer that the CT-PID rate fall was caused by \\nthe NCSP policy and its implementation since 2008. We were \\nnot able to analyze changes in PID in the same way prior to 2009 \\ndue  to  changes  in  data  collection.  An  increase  in  all  PID  and \\nCT-PID  was  observed  between  2004  and  2009;  however,  this \\nwas alongside increased attendance following the government\\u2019s \\n2004  white  paper  [16],  which  identified  improving  sexual \\nhealth services as a priority and was associated with an increase \\nin funding. Similar increases in capacity following service im-\\nprovements have been reported as the cause of increase in PID \\nrates in SSHSs in Australia [17].\\n\\nOther studies have looked at changes in PID over time; how-\\never,  the  associated  infections  were  often  not  available  and \\nmany  studies  used  rates  for  females  with  PID  treated  in  hos-\\npital [6, 7, 18\\u201320]. The majority of females diagnosed with PID \\nare managed in an outpatient or community setting with some \\nevidence that CT-PID may have a milder clinical presentation \\nthan other causes and thus be less likely to require admission to \\nhospital [6, 19]. In addition, the proportion of PID caused by \\nCT decreases with age [3]. It is thus difficult to use such data to \\nexamine the effect of CT control measures when using all PID \\nas an outcome measure [7].\\n\\nS118  \\u2022  jid  2021:224  (Suppl 2)  \\u2022  Davis et\\u00a0al\\n\\nNevertheless, our results are not inconsistent with the find-\\nings  from  the  following  studies.  The  pooled  risk  ratio  for \\nall-cause  PID  after  1\\u00a0 year  of  follow-up  in  females  invited  to \\nhave  a  chlamydia  screening  test  in  4  randomized  controlled \\ntrials (RCTs) was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], .45\\u2013.90; \\nI2\\u00a0=\\u00a020%) after 1\\u00a0year [21]. In the recent Australian Chlamydia \\nControl Effectiveness Pilot (ACCEPt) trial, the incidence of PID \\ndiagnosed  in  hospital  decreased  by  1.37  per  100\\u00a0 000  women \\n(95%  CI,  .5\\u201326.9)  [20].  However,  there  was  no  change  in  the \\nincidence of PID diagnosed in clinics.\\n\\nThe NCSP was nationally implemented in 2008 and it is un-\\nclear  why  a  drop  was  only  observed  from  2009.  The  official \\nestimated coverage in females (assuming 1 test per female) in-\\ncreased from 30.9% in 2008\\u20132009 to 42.1% in 2010\\u20132011 but \\nis likely to be lower as some females will have tested more than \\nonce  in  any  given  year  [22,  23].  The  NCSP  promotes  annual \\ntesting, which in the first year would only prevent 55%\\u201366% of \\nCT-PID cases in those screened [24]. It is possible that any re-\\nductions in CT-PID in 2008 and 2009 may have been obscured \\nby the increases in SSHS attendances between 2004 and 2009 as \\ndescribed\\u00a0above.\\n\\nFinally,  CT  positivity  in  females  with  PID  attending  SSHSs \\nis  lower  than  that  estimated  through  a  recent  multiparameter \\nevidence  (MPES)  synthesis  [3,  6].  It  is  unclear  why  that  is, \\nbut the CT positivity is similar to that observed in Australian \\nSSHSs [25]. This may reflect a low index of suspicion as recom-\\nmended in the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV \\nPID guidelines and would include females with \\u201cpossible\\u201d PID \\nwhereas the MPES analysis considered only females with prob-\\nable or definite PID and used data obtained before the introduc-\\ntion of screening [6, 26].\\n\\nOur data and analyses show an ecological trend that is broadly \\nconsistent  with  widespread  screening  through  the  NCSP  re-\\nducing the incidence of CT-PID as observed in previous RCTs \\n[21]. It is of interest that nonspecific PID rates also decreased, \\nbut to a lesser extent and later than the CT-PID rates with the \\nproportion of CT- PID, decreasing from 14.1% to 9.6% between \\n2009  and  2019,  while  GC-PID  increased.  One  explanation  as \\ndiscussed by Horner et\\u00a0al elsewhere in this special supplement is \\nthat CT infection of the fallopian tubes can result in a persistent \\nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state as a result of \\nepigenetic  changes  [27].  Such  a  state  is  proinflammatory  and \\ncould  increase  the  risk  of  nonspecific  PID  developing  in  fe-\\nmales whose upper genital tract is colonized by bacterial vag-\\ninosis\\u2013associated  bacteria  (BVAB)  [27,  28].  EMT  reduces  the \\nintegrity of the epithelium, potentially making it more suscep-\\ntible  to  invasion  and  disease  from  BVAB  [27].  BVAB  are  the \\nmost common cause of nonspecific PID [1, 2, 27]. It is likely if \\nCT-PID rates decreased so did upper genital tract CT infection, \\nwhich is not always symptomatic [6, 27]. This would then re-\\nduce the subsequent risk of developing PID from any cause [18, \\n19, 27]. Horner et\\u00a0al argue that this hypothesis merits further \\n\\nl\\n\\nD\\no\\nw\\nn\\no\\na\\nd\\ne\\nd\\n\\n \\nf\\nr\\no\\nm\\nh\\n\\n \\n\\nt\\nt\\n\\np\\ns\\n:\\n/\\n/\\n\\ni\\n\\na\\nc\\na\\nd\\ne\\nm\\nc\\n.\\no\\nu\\np\\n.\\nc\\no\\nm\\n\\n/\\nj\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\nd\\na\\nr\\nt\\ni\\nc\\ne\\n2\\n2\\n4\\nS\\nu\\np\\np\\ne\\nm\\ne\\nn\\n_\\n2\\nS\\n1\\n1\\n3\\n6\\n3\\n5\\n2\\n1\\n4\\n9\\nb\\ny\\n \\nI\\n\\n \\n\\nt\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\nn\\ns\\nt\\n \\nI\\n\\ni\\n\\ni\\n\\nn\\nv\\n \\nB\\no\\nm\\ne\\nd\\nc\\na\\ns\\n \\nu\\ns\\ne\\nr\\n \\no\\nn\\n1\\n0\\nA\\nu\\ng\\nu\\ns\\nt\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2\\n0\\n2\\n3\\n\\n\\finvestigation as it would increase our understanding of the risks \\nof  sequelae  associated  with  chlamydial  genital  tract  infection \\nand thus better inform public health interventions and cost-ef-\\nfectiveness models of interventions such as screening and vac-\\ncination [27, 29, 30].\\n\\nConsideration should be given to investigating whether se-\\nrology  as  discussed  by  Horner  elsewhere  in  this  supplement \\ncan be used to evaluate whether there is an observable birth co-\\nhort effect on CT tubal factor infertility similar to what we have \\ndemonstrated  for  CT-PID  [31].  Most  females  with  infertility \\npresent years after the inciting infection has resolved and would \\nno  longer  be  detected  by  nucleic  acid  amplification  testing  or \\nother tests for active urogenital infection [6, 31].\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nThere was a marked decline in diagnoses of CT PID, and non-\\nspecific  PID,  at  SSHSs  after  the  introduction  of  widespread \\nchlamydia screening, while GC-PID diagnoses increased. This \\noccurred despite an increase in attendances at SSHSs and along-\\nside a far smaller decline in diagnoses of vaginosis/vaginitis due \\nto bacterial vaginosis and candidosis. Further work is needed, \\nincluding to explore trends in general practice and hospital ad-\\nmissions, to determine whether the frequency of CT-PID (rates, \\nor more likely as a proportion of all PID) in SHSSs might offer \\na useful national and local metric for the success of chlamydia \\ncontrol.\\n\\nSupplementary\\u00a0Data\\n\\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious \\nDiseases online.
